### Credits
I read Udacity Mentor questions asked by other people and the answers to help me with this project. I also used the Pandas documentation. I also used Stack Overflow answers including:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41286569/get-total-of-pandas-column/41286607 and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24870306/how-to-check-if-a-column-exists-in-pandas

I used the answer to this question to check the data of the rows with the longest trip durations:
